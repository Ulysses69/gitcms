	Sams Whois Configuration File.

	This file contains details on whois servers and which tlds use them.
	You can edit this file to add or remove whois servers and tlds from the
	script.

	1) The servers list

	Each whois server appears on a single line, with configuration info separated by a |
	The fields are: whois server, available match, match for authoratitive server, text to clean, fields to hilight.

	The whois server field can also contain extra text to submit to the server before the domain.
	For example, specifiying "domain " before the domain name for whois.crsnic.net ensures that the result
	for that specific domain is returned. Separate this value from the server name with a #

	The available match just contains some text to search for that determines that the domain is available.

	The auth. server match is used for tlds like com & net to indicate the position in the whois result where
	the name of the authoratitive server to use is.

	The cleanup text is a string to match with the whois data for cleaning the result. It should be preceeded by
	either a > or a <. If a > is used, then this string and all text after it will be removed. If a < is used,
	then this string and all text before it will be removed from the result (if cleaning is turned on).

	The fields to hilight section contains a list of strings which match the beginning of lines in the whois
	output to hilight. Separate each of these with a #.

	2) The tlds list

	The tlds list matches each tld to the whois server to use to look it up, in the form tld=server

	3) The default hilight list.

	The line after this comment, defaulthilight=... contains a list of strings to use for the hilighting for any
	server which doesn't have hilighting set already.
