== WHAT IT IS ==

The Events plugin provides a backend interface to manage events and an API
to use event data on the front end.

Dependencies:
	- Wolf CMS 0.6.0+
	- PHP 5.2 or higher
	- MySQL (SQLite not supported)

If you wish to use Frog CMS 0.9.5 instead of Wolf CMS, you will need to apply
a patch to allow front-end controllers for plugins. This patch can be found at
http://morgan.net.au/labs/events

== HOW TO USE IT ==

Events can be created using the 'Events' tab in the admin section.

You can include a calendar on your front-end with the following PHP code:

<?php echo events_showEvents(); ?>

You can include a smaller mini-calendar like so:

<?php echo events_showEvents(true); ?>

This is useful to put into a Snippet, which you can include in your Layouts.

== NOTES ==
